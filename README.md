**#100DaysOfDevops** is a challenge to read official documentations, FAQs and white papers of AWS different services and do hands-on practice of AWS services , Docker ,Kubernetes and Jenkins with the aim to get AWS Solution Architect Associate , AWS Developer Associate &amp; Kubernetes Administrator certification.

**How am I taking this challenge?***

I will dedicate at least 3 hours from my day for this challenge and will share my progress of what Iâ€™ve learned during that day in [today-I-learned.md](https://github.com/ZunairaSid/100-Days-Of-DevOps/blob/master/today-I-learned.md)
